order: 10

## Submission
Authors are expected to submit the following:

* A PDF with an abstract for the artifact, which specifies the core idea, the focus of the artefact, and what the evaluation should check
* A PDF of the most recent version of the accepted paper
Documentation about the artifact (how to reproduce the contributions of the paper)
* A link to the artifact, which must be available anonymously (artifact evaluation is single-blind)


## Process

Artifact evaluation is a separate process from paper reviews, and authors will be asked to submit their artifacts only after their papers have been (conditionally) accepted for publication at WOOT.

After artifact submission, at least one member of the AEC will download and install the artifact (where relevant) and evaluate it. Since we anticipate small glitches with installation and use, reviewers may communicate with authors to help resolve glitches while preserving reviewer anonymity. The AEC will complete its evaluation and notify authors of the outcome.
